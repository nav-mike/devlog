This week was quite difficult. I decided to deep dive into game development.
I want to build a video game like Stardew Valley.

Week 1:

- defined a tech stack: unity
- built this dev blog using Astro
- started a Unity course (thx [CodeMonkey](https://unitycodemonkey.com/kitchenchaoscourse.php))

This is the game [build](https://github.com/nav-mike/devlog/releases/tag/week1) for week 1 (it's completely empty).

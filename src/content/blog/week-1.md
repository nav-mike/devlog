The first week of my indie game dev journey has been a whirlwind of emotions! I started with a surge of excitement, picturing the cozy, charming world I wanted to create—a **Stardew Valley inspired game**. The idea of building something from scratch, a digital world where players can explore, farm, and build relationships, felt incredibly motivating for this **game development** adventure.

However, that initial excitement quickly met the reality of just how much there is to learn. Diving into the **Unity game engine**, choosing assets, and setting up this **Astro dev blog** initially felt like standing at the foot of a massive mountain. There were moments of feeling overwhelmed, wondering if I'd bitten off more than I could chew.

Despite these challenges, the passion for the project and the clear vision of the **Stardew Valley inspired game** I want to make kept me going. Stardew Valley isn't just a game to me; it's an experience. It’s a peaceful escape, a creative outlet, and a testament to what a single developer can achieve. That's the kind of feeling I want to recreate. This week was tough, yes, but it also laid the foundation for an incredible adventure in **2D game development**.

Week 1 Progress - My First **Weekly Devlog** Entry:

- **Defined the Tech Stack (Unity Game Engine):** After research, I chose the **Unity game engine**. Its rich asset store, large community, and cross-platform capabilities made it a strong contender for my **Stardew Valley inspired game**. Unity's visual scripting tools and C# also seem well-suited for the cozy farming/life sim I'm aiming for with my **2D game development** efforts. The initial setup was a bit daunting, but exploring the interface and basic tutorials helped me get my bearings.
- **Built this Dev Blog (Astro & Markdown):** Keeping a **weekly devlog** is crucial for tracking progress and staying motivated on this **indie game dev journey**. I chose Astro for its speed and content-focused design to create this **Astro dev blog**. Getting a basic blog running with Markdown for posts was surprisingly straightforward. This process also helped me get more comfortable with Git for version control and site deployment. It’s a simple setup, but effective for sharing my **game development** progress.
- **Started a Unity Course (CodeMonkey's Kitchen Chaos):** For a practical introduction to the **Unity game engine**, I started [CodeMonkey's Kitchen Chaos course](https://unitycodemonkey.com/kitchenchaoscourse.php). Early modules covered Unity editor basics, game objects, components, prefabs, and fundamental C# scripting (like player movement and interactions). Seeing a small game take shape quickly, even with simple cubes, was very rewarding. This hands-on approach is definitely solidifying concepts vital for **2D game development**.

This is the game [build](https://github.com/nav-mike/devlog/releases/tag/week1) for week 1. It's completely empty – just a placeholder to test the build process for my **Stardew Valley inspired game**!

## Wrapping Up Week 1 and Looking Ahead

So, that's a wrap for week one of my **indie game dev journey**! This week was all about laying the groundwork. I chose the **Unity game engine**, set up this **Astro dev blog** (my **weekly devlog**) to document the journey, and dove into Unity's fundamentals with CodeMonkey's course.

The first game build is, as promised, hilariously empty. However, it marks a crucial first step: the project officially exists! This week was a mix of excitement and a steep learning curve in **game development**. While there's a mountain to climb, the progress so far feels rewarding.

Next week, I plan to continue with the Unity course, hopefully getting into more complex mechanics for my **Stardew Valley-inspired game**. I also want to start thinking about the core gameplay loops and perhaps begin sketching out some initial ideas for the art style. It's still early days in my **2D game development** adventure, but the journey has begun.

Thanks for reading this **weekly devlog** entry, and I hope you'll join me next week to see how things progress on my **Stardew Valley inspired game**!

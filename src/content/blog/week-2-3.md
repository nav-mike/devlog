It was quite hard two weeks:

1. I was very busy in my every day job, so I did not do much
2. Fixed this blog a bit
3. Watched a couple of video lessons about Unity fundamentals
4. Found a really nice assets bundle
5. Figured out how to work with tail map in Unity
6. Prepared tiles and tried to create a simple lake.
